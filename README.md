# Codeday-Dehradun-Platformer
 reference game for game dev workshop at Codeday dehradun

this is a basic game in which horizontal movement is using the arrow keys and jump using the space key.
its really chill - you start at left end - then you just have to hop around the platforms and reach the blue-red mythical gate at the right end, once you reach there - you win (psps you can still hop even after you win)
